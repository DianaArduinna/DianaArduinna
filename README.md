### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Diana Jimenez Mora, a Test Automation Engineer with a passion for quality assurance and creating seamless software experiences. Previously, I was an English Teacher, but my journey led me to transition into the world of tech.

I honed my coding skills through self-study and at a FullStack Java Bootcamp, where I was fortunate to receive a scholarship from Talento Digital Chile. This experience solidified my love for coding and technology.

With a background in education and now in tech, I bring a unique perspective to my work. I'm adept at REST API and mobile testing, having spent 2 enriching years at Globant, where I continue learning and expanding my skills.

I'm a dedicated learner, constantly seeking out new tutorials and documentation to stay up-to-date with the latest trends in the field. Quality assurance is my mantra, and I'm enthusiastic about creating efficient and robust test frameworks.

Let's connect, collaborate, and bring exceptional software to life! ðŸš€"
